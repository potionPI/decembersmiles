        What is December Smiles?
        </h1>
        <p>
        December Smiles is a community service opportunity in which all the participants create items, whether it be scarves, food, or otherwise. These handcrafted items may be given to anyone the participant wishes, in hopes of brightening someone's day, and making them smile.
